  By not providing "FindPahoMqttC.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "PahoMqttC", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "PahoMqttC" with
  any of the following names:

    PahoMqttCConfig.cmake
    pahomqttc-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "PahoMqttC" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "PahoMqttC_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "PahoMqttC" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
